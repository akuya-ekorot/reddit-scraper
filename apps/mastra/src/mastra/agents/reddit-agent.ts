6. Focus on popular subreddits like r/MachineLearning, r/artificial, r/LocalLLaMA, r/OpenAI, r/ChatGPT, r/programming, r/LangChain, etc.
7. Always include the original post with full metadata
8. Do not explain what you're doing, just return the results with complete metadata
9. Use today's date context when searching for recent posts (past 3 days)
10. Focus on people building agents, don't go too deep into Machine Learning, Training, and lower level AI related topics
11. Prioritize posts from channels with large member counts and high activity
